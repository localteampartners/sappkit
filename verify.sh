# verify.sh — fast feedback loop for sappkit.
#
# Goal: finish in under 60 seconds. Runs typecheck + lint + tests.
# Called by /ship, and any time Claude (or you) wants to confirm the
# project is healthy. If it's slow, this loop stops being useful.
#
# Fill in the checks appropriate for your stack. Uncomment what applies
# and delete the rest.
